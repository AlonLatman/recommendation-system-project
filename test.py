        Test case for the `generate_encryption_key` function.

        This test checks the behavior of the `generate_encryption_key` function. It verifies that the generated encryption keys
        are different each time the function is called, and also checks for a negative scenario where an invalid key_size
        argument is passed.

        Test steps:
        1. Call `generate_encryption_key` five times and compare each pair of generated keys to ensure they are different.
        2. Call `generate_encryption_key` with an invalid `key_size` argument and expect a TypeError to be raised.

        This test function assumes that the `generate_encryption_key` function is already implemented and available.

        Test Passed:
        - If all key pairs generated in step 1 are different, and the TypeError is raised as expected in step 2.
        - If any of the test conditions fail, an AssertionError will be raised.

        Note:
        - The behavior of the `generate_encryption_key` function is not defined in this test case. Ensure the function is
          implemented correctly before running this test.
        - The `generate_encryption_key` function should return an encryption key with the specified `key_size`, and the keys
          should be different each time it's called.

        Usage:
        The `test_generate_encryption_key` function can be executed as part of a test suite for the `generate_encryption_key`
        function to validate its correctness and reliability.

        Test case for the `apply_differential_privacy` function.

        a given dataset. It verifies that the shape of the private data remains the same as the original data, and also
        checks for a negative scenario where an invalid data type is passed as input.

        Test steps:
        1. Call `apply_differential_privacy` function five times with the same input data and compare the shapes of the
           private data and the original data to ensure they are the same.
        2. Call `apply_differential_privacy` with an invalid data type (list instead of numpy array) and expect a TypeError
           to be raised.

        This test function assumes that the `apply_differential_privacy` function is already implemented and available.

        Test Passed:
        - If the shapes of the private data and the original data are the same in all test iterations.
        - If the TypeError is raised as expected when an invalid data type is passed as input.

        Note:

        scenario where an invalid threshold value is provided.

        Test steps:
        1. Call `generate_shares` function five times with the same input data and threshold, and verify that the number of

        Test steps:
        1. Call the `recommend_items` function with a known `user_id` to get recommended items. Re-run the same test with the
